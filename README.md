# TimeScriber TUI
A note taking app that timestamps your notes! Built off of TUI (https://textual.textualize.io/) to create a simple platform for recording meeting minutes and taking notes during usability testing.

## Basic `run` instructions:

1. Create an anaconda environment with `python==3.10.8`
2. `pip install textual` -> see https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/ for more details
3. Manually add any packages in the `requirements.txt` folder, **OR** 
4. ... navigate to the folder containing `requirements.txt` and run 
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. In a terminal set to your conda environment, set the current directory (`cd`) to the folder containing `timescriber.py`
6. Type `textual run timescriber.py` and hit enter :)

TimeScriber should be running!

Note: These instructions are "quick and dirty". I hope to have an `.exe` of TimeScriber soon!
